                This is Raft Fighter, a project I helped make in MI 445 along with some other classmates. On this project,
                I was responsible for the player sprite on the island levels, the shark and turtle enemies, the UI and the Shop Menu.
                This was the full complete game project I made with a team in college and I am quite proud of the spritework I did, especially
                in the shop and enemies. Click on the picture to visit the itch.io page and try it out.
