            My name is Sebastian Garda, and this is my portfolio/website! I am an aspiring
            game developer who is currently in my junior year of college at Michigan State University,
            majoring in Media and Information with a minor in Game Design and Development. This website, as
            stated, was made as a portfolio to show off my games that I've created for classes here at MSU, as
            well as to serve as my final project for MI349 Web Design and Development.<br><br>My passion in game design is level design specifically. I enjoy the intricacies of teaching a player
            as they play. Figuring out how to do that is like a puzzle to me. I also love character design as I find, for me at 
            least, it's one of the primary things that initially draws me to a game and keeps me interested and invested. I am practiced
            in pixel art as well as physical pencil and paper art and am teaching myself how to use blender. I am also 
            looking to get better at digital art using Clip Studio Paint. I have extensive experience with the Unity game 
            engine thanks to my 3 years of education at MSU.<br><br>My family moved around quite a bit when I was a 
            kid, so i'm very much used to adapting to new environments and being the new face around. I find it very 
            easy to meet new people and get integrated. I find myself to be a social chameleon, and I appreciate talking 
            and listening to people and getting to know them better.<br><br>My hobbies are playing video games, listening 
            to music, watching movies and tv shows, drawing, reading, and collecting figures from games I enjoy. I hope one 
            day to be able to own a physical copy of a game I worked on and helped publish, that I can show to my freinds and 
            family.
