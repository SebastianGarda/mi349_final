            My name is Sebastian Garda, and this is my portfolio/website! I am an aspiring
            game developer who is currently in my junior year of college at Michigan State University,
            majoring in Media and Information with a minor in Game Design and Development. This website, as
            stated, was made as a portfolio to show off my games that I've created for classes here at msu, as
            well as to serve as my final project for MI 349 Web Design and Development.
